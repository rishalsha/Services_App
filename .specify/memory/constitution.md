# Services_App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Performant and Clean Code
All code must be written with performance and readability in mind. This includes following Flutter best practices, avoiding unnecessary computations, and ensuring the codebase is easy to maintain and understand.

### II. Material Design
The application's user interface will adhere to Google's Material Design guidelines. Use and customize the MaterialApp theme to ensure a consistent and high-quality user experience.

### III. Pragmatic Testing
While Test-Driven Development (TDD) is not a strict requirement, writing tests is highly encouraged. Focus on creating unit and widget tests for critical parts of the application to ensure stability and prevent regressions.
