# Feature Specification: Video Playback Enhancements

**Feature Branch**: `002-video-playback-enhancements`  
**Created**: Wednesday, 1 October 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to polish the video playing screen. Add more control over the playback. Add seek functionality."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to have more control over video playback, including the ability to seek to specific points in the video, so that I can easily navigate and re-watch parts of the content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a video is playing, **When** the user drags the seek bar, **Then** the video playback position updates accordingly.
2. **Given** a video is playing, **When** the user taps on a specific point on the seek bar, **Then** the video jumps to that position.
3. **Given** a video is playing, **When** the user uses forward/backward skip buttons, **Then** the video skips by a predefined interval (e.g., 10 seconds).

### Edge Cases
- **EC-001**: When the user attempts to seek beyond the video's duration, the playback MUST snap to the end of the video.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST display a seek bar during video playback.
- **FR-002**: The seek bar MUST visually represent the current playback position and the total duration of the video.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to drag the seek bar to change the video playback position.
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to tap on the seek bar to jump to a specific video playback position.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide controls (e.g., buttons) to skip forward and backward by a 10-second interval.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST update the video playback in real-time as the user interacts with the seek functionality.
